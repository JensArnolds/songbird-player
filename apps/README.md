# Apps

This directory is the target home for application runtimes:

- `web`: Next.js App Router app (current `src/*` + `public/*` + server routes)
- `desktop`: Electron shell (current `electron/*` and desktop packaging scripts)
- `mobile`: Future React Native / Expo client

Current runtime remains at repository root until migration PRs move code.
